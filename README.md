- **User Interface**: 
  - View all projects and todos.
  - Expand todos to view and edit details.
  - Delete todos.
  - Visualize different priorities with color-coding.
- **Persistence**: Utilizes Web Storage API (localStorage) to save todos and projects, ensuring data is preserved between page reloads.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: For application logic and DOM manipulation.
- **Webpack**: For module bundling and asset management.
- **date-fns**: For date formatting and manipulation.
- **localStorage**: For data persistence.
